"""
Shared state schema for the FinTech digest LangGraph.

Every node reads from and writes to this TypedDict.
LangGraph merges node outputs into the state automatically using
the reducer functions defined via Annotated[..., reducer].

State lifecycle:
  start → news_agent → memory_agent → curator_agent → builder_agent
        → delivery_agent → calendar_agent → END

The checkpointer snapshots state after each node, so if any node
fails the run can be resumed from that exact point.
